  abstract = {The Nepal Himalaya is a transition zone for pollutants transport from the South Asia onto the Tibetan Plateau, with the moist convection identified as dominating the chemical composition that would be transported onto the Plateau. Yet little is known regarding the atmospheric water vapor transport over this region, and how the summer monsoon flows would interact with local topography, with traces detectable from ground sample and observations. The stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation ({$\delta$}18Op and {$\delta$}Dp) are important tracers for understanding various hydrological processes. This study reports, for the first time, stable isotope data in daily precipitation at five stations along a north-south transect on the southern slope of Himalaya, with altitudes ranging from 102 m to 5050 m above sea level (a.s.l). The altitude effect of {$\delta$}18Op across the region of interest is apparent with an altitudinal lapse rate as 0.17{\textperthousand}/100 m. Seasonal trends in {$\delta$}18Op and {$\delta$}Dp show low values during June{\textendash}September and higher values during October{\textendash}May at all of the study sites, with the noticeable decrease of {$\delta$}18Op during summer indicative of the presence of the Indian monsoon over the eastern Nepal Himalaya. The average d-excess values in the summer precipitation increase with altitudes til 3800 m a.s.l before decreasing afterward to 5050 m a.s.l. This corroborates with previous meteorological discovery in the region, and probably confirms the replacement of prevailing westerly by the southerly monsoon flows during summer monsoon season.},

  abstract = {Extreme precipitation events and associated hazards are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. On June 2021, a devastating flash flood occurred in the Melamchi River in Nepal causing immense destruction to lives and property. The flood event was cascading in nature and associated with multiple driving factors. This study evaluates the post-extreme flood conditions of the Melamchi Flood 2021 (MF21). Rainfall, streamflow (discharge), and gauge height (water level) data of the nearest stations were analyzed. Since there was a lack of reliable instantaneous river discharge during the disastrous MF21, this study developed the flow rating curves at hydrometric stations. Post-extreme flood was evaluated considering upstream catchment hydrology, glacial lake outbursts, landslide damming, and the hydrodynamic propagations using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model and gauge-to-gauge (G2G) correlation. The results were then compared to field observations. The HEC-RAS model was simulated for several flood frequency periods in different return periods (namely 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 years). Results showed that the average 24 h gauge height and discharge at Nakote station (a few km downstream of landslide damming) are 15.88 m and 169.18 m3/s, in which the model-based highest frequency of 1-h extreme flood and return period can reach 716 m3/s in 1000 years. During MF21, the discharge of the Nakote region at the 10 min intervals was estimated to be with a maximum of 7162.10 m3/s, an average of 2207.13 m3/s and a minimum of 237.44 m3/s.Additionally, the outburst discharge from glacial lake at high elevation was estimated to be 295.14 m3/s contributing to downstream flooding. The model-based discharge during the past flood period was also estimated in 9 cross-section points of the river in which discharge at the damming area was 63.81 m3/s and downstream Dumredovan was 1206.58 m3/s. This research provides valuable insights to post-extreme flood evaluation and the approach can be used for other watersheds in evaluating post flood conditions.},

This study has investigated these extreme flood events and their nexus with climate i.e. precipitation and temperature. The available daily and hourly hydro-meteorological data were analyzed. The regional flow during both flood events were estimated using 1-D hydraulic HEC-HMS model and the correlation among rainfall -runoff, temperature with snow water equivalent were examined. Result show that the Melamchi region found an average annual rainfall of 2610 mm during 1992{\textendash}2021. Specifically, the middle section i.e. Shermathang and Tarkeghang has observed the highest daily average rainfall of 26.8 mm and 39.2 mm during the first and 61.4 mm and 66.6 mm during the second flood event, respectively. The discharge found at the Melamchi town segment was at 2893 \-m3/s and 1105 \-m3/s in the first and second events respectively in which regional contribution into discharge were found significant. The Bhemathang, which is landslide damming area where The daily average discharge observed 357 \-m3/s and 76 \-m3/s on both events, respectively. At the Nakote, the rainfall and runoff are poorly correlated while snow water equivalent and temperature showed positive correlation during summer. The snowmelt contribution to discharge was found 9.68 \-m3/s in the Melamchi River during the Summer season. The regional contribution to discharge and spatial variations of precipitation during flooding events showed that precipitation is the main climatic driver while temporary damming and increasing temperature also contributes to the magnitude of the Melamchi flood.},

  abstract = {We combine experimental and modeling results from a headwater catchment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, USA, to explore the link between stream solute dynamics and water age. A theoretical framework based on water age dynamics, which represents a general basis for characterizing solute transport at the catchment scale, is here applied to conservative and weatheringderived solutes. Based on the available information about the hydrology of the site, an integrated transport model was developed and used to compute hydrochemical fluxes. The model was designed to reproduce the deuterium content of streamflow and allowed for the estimate of catchment water storage and dynamic travel time distributions (TTDs). The innovative contribution of this paper is the simulation of dissolved silicon and sodium concentration in streamflow, achieved by implementing first-order chemical kinetics based explicitly on dynamic TTD, thus upscaling local geochemical processes to catchment scale. Our results highlight the key role of water stored within the subsoil glacial material in both the short-term and long-term solute circulation. The travel time analysis provided an estimate of streamflow age distributions and their evolution in time related to catchment wetness conditions. The use of age information to reproduce a 14 year data set of silicon and sodium stream concentration shows that, at catchment scales, the dynamics of such geogenic solutes are mostly controlled by hydrologic drivers, which determine the contact times between the water and mineral interfaces. Justifications and limitations toward a general theory of reactive solute circulation at catchment scales are discussed.},

  abstract = {We review new and published analyses of river waters, bedloads and their constituent minerals from the Dhauli Ganga and Alaknanda, headwaters of the Ganges in Garhwal, and the Marsyandi in Nepal and their tributaries. These data are used to discriminate between the inputs of major cations and Sr from silicate and carbonate sources. Methods of estimating the proportion of the carbonate and silicate inputs to river waters using mixing arrays in Sr-Ca-Mg-Na-K-87Sr/86Sr space are shown to suffer from systematic correlations between the magnitude of the precipitation of secondary calcite and the fraction of the silicate component. This results in factor-oftwo overestimates of the fractions of silicate-derived Ca, Mg and Sr. To correct for this the magnitude of secondary calcite precipitated and relative fractions of silicate and carbonate-derived cations are instead calculated by modeling the displacement of water compositions from the compositions of the carbonate and silicate components of the bedload in subsets of Sr-Ca-Mg-Na-K-87Sr/86Sr space. The compositions of the carbonate and silicate end-members in the bedload are determined by sequential leaching. The results of this modeling are compared with modeling of the modal mineral inputs to waters where mineral compositions are derived from electronmicroprobe analyses of the minerals in the bedload. In the upper Marsyandi catchment, which drains low-grade Tethyan Sedimentary Series formations, a set of mainstem samples collected over a two-year period define tight correlations in Sr-Ca-Mg-Na-K87Sr/86Sr space. Modeling of the magnitude of secondary carbonate precipitation and fractions of silicate-derived Ca, Mg and Sr in Sr-Ca-Mg-87Sr/86Sr space gives selfconsistent results that are compatible with both the calculations of mineral modes and published Mg-isotopic compositions, if the ratio of chlorite to biotite weathering is high or if there is another silicate source of Mg. These calculations imply that between 12 and 31 percent of the Sr and 44 and 72 percent of the Mg is derived from silicate minerals where the range reflects the seasonal change in the ratio of silicate-derived to carbonate-derived cations. Modeling in Sr-Ca-Na and/or K space is inconsistent with the Sr-isotopic and Mg-isotopic constraints and we conclude that in this catchment dissolution of Na and K are incongruent relative to Sr-Ca-Mg. Potassium is preferentially retained in micas whereas the controls on Na are unclear. Modeling of the catchments underlain by High Himalayan Crystalline and Lesser Himalayan Series in Garhwal is complicated by the presence of dolomite as well as calcite in the carbonate and the results imply that dolomite dissolves faster in the acetic acid leaches than in nature. Up to 60 percent of the Sr in the catchment on High Himalayan Crystalline Series and 20 to 30 percent of Sr in the catchments on Lesser Himalayan Series are estimated to be derived from silicates. However it should be noted that the element budgets are not all self-consistent and the use of bedrock-element ratios to model the sources of chemical inputs to river waters remains subject to uncertainties.},

  abstract = {The hydrological budget of Himalayan rivers is dominated by monsoonal rainfall and snowmelt, but their relative impact is not well established because this remote region lacks a dense gauge network. Here, we use a combination of validated remotely-sensed climate parameters to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall, snowfall, and evapotranspiration in order to quantify their relative contribution to mean river discharge. Rainfall amounts are calculated from calibrated, orbital, high-resolution Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission data, and snow-water equivalents are computed from a snowmelt model based on satellite-derived snow cover, surface temperature, and solar radiation. Our data allow us to identify three key aspects of the spatiotemporal precipitation pattern. First, we observe a strong decoupling between the rainfall on the Himalayan foreland versus that in the mountains: a pronounced sixfold, east-west rainfall gradient in the Ganges plains exists only at elevations {$<$}500 m asl. Mountainous regions (500 to 5000 m asl) receive nearly equal rainfall amounts along strike. Second, whereas the Indian summer monsoon is responsible for more than 80\% of annual rainfall in the central Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, the eastern and western syntaxes receive only {$\sim$}50\% of their annual rainfall during the summer season. Third, snowmelt contributions to discharge differ widely along the range. As a fraction of the total annual discharge, snowmelt constitutes up to 50\% in the far western (Indus area) catchments, {$\sim$}25\% in far eastern (Tsangpo) catchments, and {$<$}20\% elsewhere. Despite these along-strike variations, snowmelt in the pre- and early-monsoon season (April to June) is significant and important in all catchments, although most pronounced in the western catchments. Thus, changes in the timing or amount of snowmelt due to increasing temperatures or decreasing winter precipitation may have far-reaching societal consequences. These new data on precipitation and runoff set the stage for far more detailed investigations than have previously been possible of climate-erosion interactions in the Himalaya.},

Whereas silicate weathering removes carbon dioxide (CO               2               ) from the atmosphere, weathering of accessory carbonate and sulfide minerals is a geologically relevant source of CO               2               . Although these weathering pathways commonly operate side by side, we lack quantitative constraints on their co-variation across erosion rate gradients. Here we use stream-water chemistry across an erosion rate gradient of three orders of magnitude in shales and sandstones of southern Taiwan, and find that sulfide and carbonate weathering rates rise with increasing erosion, while silicate weathering rates remain steady. As a result, on timescales shorter than marine sulfide compensation (approximately 10               6               {\textendash}10               7               years), weathering in rapidly eroding terrain leads to net CO               2               emission rates that are about twice as fast as CO               2               sequestration rates in slow-eroding terrain. We propose that these weathering reactions are linked and that sulfuric acid generated from sulfide oxidation boosts carbonate solubility, whereas silicate weathering kinetics remain unaffected, possibly due to efficient buffering of the pH. We expect that these patterns are broadly applicable to many Cenozoic mountain ranges that expose marine metasediments.},

RT is highly multidisciplinary, which hinders the development of a body of knowledge shared by RT modelers and developers. The goal of this paper is to review the basic conceptual issues shared by all RT problems, so as to facilitate advancement along the current frontier: biochemical reactions. To this end, we review the basic equations to indicate that chemical systems are controlled by the set of equilibrium reactions, which are easy to model, but whose rate is controlled by mixing. Since mixing is not properly represented by the standard advection-dispersion equation (ADE), we conclude that this equation is poor for RT. This leads us to review alternative transport formulations, and the methods to solve RT problems using both the ADE and alternative equations. Since equilibrium is easy, difficulties arise for kinetic reactions, which is especially true for biochemistry, where numerous challenges are open (how to represent microbial communities, impact of genomics, effect of biofilms on flow and transport, etc.). We conclude with the basic eleven conceptual issues that we consider fundamental for any conceptually sound RT effort.},

  abstract = {Permeability exerts significant control over the development of pore pressure excess in the crust, and it is a physical quantity sensitively dependent on the pore structure and stress state. In many applications, the relation between permeability and effective mean stress is assumed to be exponential and that between permeability and porosity is assumed to be a power law, so that the pressure sensitivity of permeability is characterized by the coefficient {\textasciitilde}, and the porosity sensitivity by the exponent {\textasciitilde}. In this study, we investigate experimentally the dependence of permeability on pressure and porosity in five sandstones with porosities ranging from 14\% to 35\% and we review published experimental data on intact rocks, unconsolidated materials and rock fractures. The laboratory data show that the pressure and porosity sensitivities differ significantly for different compaction mechanisms, but for a given compaction mechanism, the data can often be approximated by the empirical relations. The permeabilities of tight rocks and rock joints show relatively high pressure sensitivity and low porosity sensitivity. A wide range of values for :t and ), have been observed in relation to the mechanical compaction of porous rocks, sand and fault gouge, whereas the porosity sensitivity for chemical compaction processes is often observed to be given by a {\textasciitilde} 3. We show that since the ratio {\textasciitilde}/a corresponds to the pore compressibility, the different dependences of permeability on porosity and pressure are related to the pore structure and its compressibility. Guided by the laboratory data, we conduct numerical simulations on the development of pore pressure in crustal tectonic settings according to the models of WALDER and NUR (1984) and RICE (1992). Laboratory data suggest that the pressure sensitivity of fault gouge is relatively low, and to maintain pore pressure at close to {\textasciitilde}he lithostatic value in the Rice model, a relatively high influx of fluid from below the seismogenic layer is necessary. The fluid may be injected as vertically propagating pressure pulses into the seismogenic system, and RICE's (1992) critical condition for the existence of solitary wave is shown to be equivalent to a {$>$} 1, which is satisfied by most geologic materials in the laboratory. Laboratory data suggest that the porosity sensitivity is relatively high {\textasciitilde}vhen the permeability is reduced by a coupled mechanical and chemical compaction process. This implies that in a crustal layer, pore pressure may be generated more efficiently than cases studied by WALDER and NUR (1984) who assumed a relatively low porosity sensitivity of CX=2.},

  abstract = {For an irreversible reaction, the Rayleigh or distillation-type relationship between stable isotope enrichment and reactant concentration is compromised if fluid samples are characterized by a range of water ages or different extents of reaction progress. Such mixed samples are rarely avoided in the standard methods of sampling fluid from natural porous media. As a result, application of a Rayleigh model to stable isotope ratios measured in aquifers commonly requires a diminished or effective fractionation factor relative to the intrinsic value obtained in the absence of transport effects. Thus, quantitative application of intrinsic parameter values to a fractionating reaction occurring in porous media flow requires revision to the functional form of the relationship between reactant concentration and isotope fractionation. Here we derive a series of analytical solutions for the relationship between fractionation and flow subject to nonuniform fluid travel time distributions. These solutions are unique from previous approaches in that they avoid the use of a dispersion coefficient. The results are demonstrated against multicomponent reactive transport simulations of stable isotope fractionation in homogeneous and spatially correlated heterogeneous flow fields, and applied to a data set of stable chromium (Cr) isotope enrichment obtained from a contaminated aquifer. We show that the flux-weighted isotope ratio of a solute is more sensitive to the effects of physical heterogeneity than solute concentrations. Our results support an updated functional form of the traditional Rayleigh model that describes the relationship between reactant concentration and isotope fractionation and is valid for a mixed-fluid sample.},

  abstract = {Plagioclase feldspars are key components of terrestrial planets and deriving their phase diagram and activity{\textendash}composition relations has been the subject of many studies. Three main approaches have been used for thermodynamic modelling of the behaviour of plagioclase feldspars, and all three disagree in terms of the magnitude and relative importance of mixing energies and ordering energies. The present study uses Monte Carlo simulations based on classical atomistic modelling to provide independent constraints over ordering and mixing for anorthite and its solid solution with albite. Unsurprisingly, Al-avoidance plays a key role. The competition between first-neighbour and second-neighbour interactions is highlighted, providing simple explanations to the high degree of short-range order in macroscopically disordered plagioclase. The mixing properties obtained in this study support strong non-ideality, with negative mixing enthalpy and temperature-dependent mixing entropy. Ordering energies are consistent with studies using Landau theory. Unfortunately, the form of the Landau equations hindered parametrisation of a full thermodynamic model from albite to anorthite, even though the thermodynamic formalism remains simple. Reasons, perspectives, and implications for the phase diagram of ternary feldspars are discussed.},

Both the concentration and isotopic composition of DSi in the tributaries increased between the highest elevations to where the Ganges leaves the Himalayas at Rishikesh. The tributaries exhibit a linear correlation between {$\delta$}30Si and DSi that may represent mixing between a low DSi, low {$\delta$}30Si (e.g., 40 {$\mu$}M, +0.5h) component potentially reflecting fractionation during adsorption of a small fraction of silicon onto iron oxides and a high DSi, high {$\delta$}30Si component (e.g., 240 {$\mu$}M, +1.7h) produced during higher intensity weathering with a greater proportional sequestration of weathered silicon into secondary minerals or biogenic silica. On the Ganges alluvial plain, in the Ganges and the Yamuna, Gomati, and their tributaries, DSi ranged from 122 to 218 {$\mu$}M while {$\delta$}30Si ranged from +1.03 {$\pm$} 0.03h to +2.46 {$\pm$} 0.06h. Highest values of {$\delta$}30Si occurred in the Gomati and its tributaries. In general, the lower DSi and higher {$\delta$}30Si of DSi in these rivers suggests control of both by removal of DSi by secondary mineral formation and/or biogenic silica production. A simple 1-dimensional model with flow through a porous medium is introduced and provides a useful framework for understanding these results.},

  abstract = {The main problem associated with the study of silicate weathering using river dissolved load is that the main control of solute chemistry is lithology and that all rivers are influenced by carbonate and evaporite weathering. In this paper, newly compiled data on the 60 largest rivers of the world are used to calculate the contribution of main lithologies, rain and atmosphere to river dissolved loads. Technically, an inverse method is used to solve a model containing of a series of mass budget equations relating river concentrations to chemical weathering products and atmospheric inputs. New estimates of global silicate weathering fluxes and associated CO2 consumption fluxes are given. The role of basalt weathering on oceanic islands and volcanic arcs is emphasized. For each large river, an attempt is made to calculate chemical weathering rates of silicates per unit area. Only relative chemical weathering rates can be calculated. The relationships between the chemical weathering rates of silicates and the possible controlling parameters are explored. A combined effect of runoff-temperature and physical denudation seems to explain the variability of modern silicate chemical weathering rates. The results of this study highlight the coupling between the physical and the chemical processes of silicate weathering. Only an active physical denudation of continental rocks seems to be able to maintain high chemical weathering rates and significant CO2 consumption rates. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Surprisingly few studies connect the chemical, mechanical, and hydrological evolution of rock as it weathers to saprolite and soil. We assess this coevolution in granodiorite from Monterey Peninsula, California, by measuring changes in bulk chemistry, mineralogy, volumetric strain, the oxidation state of Fe in biotite crystals, tensile strength, abrasion rate, connected porosity, and hydraulic conductivity in samples covering a range of weathering grades. We identify the oxidative dissolution of biotite as the key chemical reaction because of the volumetric expansion that accompanies formation of altered biotite and precipitation of ferrihydrite. We show how the associated accumulation of elastic strain produces an energy density that is sufficient to support rock fracturing over length scales equivalent to constituent crystals. The resulting intragranular and intergranular cracking profoundly reduces tensile strength and increases the abrasion rate, connected porosity, and hydraulic conductivity of the rock matrix. These changes increase the rate of plagioclase weathering, and ultimately the rock disintegrates into grus and clay. Major changes in rock properties can occur with only minor element leaching, and the threshold behavior of weathering that arises from the coevolution of chemical, hydrological, and mechanical properties may be difficult to capture using simplified weathering models that fail to incorporate these properties. Our results, which combine the mechanical and hydrological evolution of weathering rock with more common measurements of chemical changes, should help to more accurately model the effects of, and mechanical and hydrological feedbacks upon, chemical weathering of rock.},

On annual to decadal timescales, large earthquakes also have the potential to significantly alter fluvial sediment dynamics if a significant volume of the sediment generated reaches the fluvial network. In this contribution, we focus on the Melamchi-Indrawati and Bhote Koshi rivers in central Nepal, which have both 5 experienced widespread landsliding associated with the 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake. Using a time series of high-resolution satellite imagery, we have mapped exposed gravel along the river from 2012-2021 to identify zones of active channel deposition and document changes over time. Counter to expectations, we show negligible increases in coarse sediment accumulation in both catchments since the Gorkha earthquake. However, an extremely high concentration flow event on 15 June 2021 caused an approximately four-fold increase in exposed gravel along a 30 km reach of the channel with up to 12 m of channel aggradation 10 in the Melamchi-Indrawati rivers; this event was localised and did not impact the neighbouring Bhote Koshi catchment. Based on published reports, new helicopter based photography and satellite data, we demonstrate that this event was sourced from a localised rainfall event between 4500 and 4800 m, and that the majority of the sediment was supplied from sources that were unrelated to the landslides generated by the Gorkha earthquake.},

Approximately 40\% of non-dam stream sites have substantial groundwater contributions as indicated by characteristic paired air and stream temperature signal metrics. Streams with shallow groundwater signatures account for half of all groundwater signature sites and show reduced baseflow and a higher proportion of warming trends compared to sites with deep groundwater signatures. These findings align with theory that shallow groundwater is more vulnerable to temperature increase and depletion.

  abstract = {Through the release of groundwater, most mountain rivers run year-round despite their small catchments and sporadic precipitation. This makes mountain ranges important sources of reliable freshwater for downstream populations in many parts of the world. However, due to a lack of ground instrumentation, little is known about groundwater dynamics in mountainous landscapes. Recent research has shown that the amount of moisture trapped in the soil and weathered rocks in the vadose zone can significantly buffer groundwater recharge and runoff but the wider recognition of this effect on major mountain systems has not been yet established. In this study, we test whether the moisture reservoir has an impact on hydrological fluxes in a steep Himalayan catchment during three monsoon seasons. We measured an array of parameters including relative seismic velocity changes from ambient noise correlations. This noninvasive technique allows us to monitor groundwater dynamics in conjunction with classical hydrological measurements. We found that the moisture saturation in the vadose zone controls the onset of groundwater recharge and runoff and therefore determines the annual water availability supplied by monsoon precipitation. We model this dynamic using a surface layer that has a finite storage capacity that controls the connectivity of surface flux to groundwater. The extension of this concept, which is thought to apply widely in flat and undulating landscapes, to steep mountain topography with thin and discontinuous soils underlain by regolith and bedrock has important implications for mountain hydrology.},

  abstract = {Groundwater 18O/16O, 2H/1H, 13C/12C, 3H, and 14C data can help quantify molecular movements and chemical reactions governing groundwater recharge, quality, storage, flow, and discharge. Here, commonly applied approaches to isotopic data analysis are reviewed, involving groundwater recharge seasonality, recharge elevations, groundwater ages, paleoclimate conditions, and groundwater discharge. Reviewed works confirm and quantify long held tenets: (i) that recharge derives disproportionately from wet season and winter precipitation; (ii) that modern groundwaters comprise little global groundwater; (iii) that ``fossil'' ({$>$}12,000-year-old) groundwaters dominate global aquifer storage; (iv) that fossil groundwaters capture late-Pleistocene climate conditions; (v) that surface-borne contaminants are more common in younger groundwaters; and (vi) that groundwater discharges generate substantial streamflow. Groundwater isotope data are disproportionately common to midlatitudes and sedimentary basins equipped for irrigated agriculture, but less plentiful across high latitudes, hyperarid deserts, and equatorial rainforests. Some of these underexplored aquifer systems may be suitable targets for future field testing. Plain Language Summary Water from the underground{\textemdash}groundwater{\textemdash}is the primary water supply to billions of humans. Understanding how groundwater originates and where it flows is important so that groundwater can be protected from pollution and overuse. One of the ways that scientists learn about groundwater is by measuring the abundances of heavier and lighter forms of elements in the groundwater. These isotopes help scientists map where groundwater comes from, measure how long it spends under the ground, and realize how important it is for generating river flows. This manuscript reviews the ways that measuring isotopes have helped scientists understand water resources and suggests ways that isotopes can contribute to understanding global groundwater resources even better.},

  abstract = {Weathering fluxes from four small catchments in the Himalayas, one forested, one agricultural, and two glacial, have been calculated by quantifying stream discharge, deposition, and biomass uptake of major ions. These fluxes were partitioned between silicate and carbonate sources by using a mineral mass-balance model. This approach provides the first well-defined estimates of Himalayan weathering fluxes from small catchments. Silicate weathering rates are highest in the favorable weathering environment of the Middle Hills catchments, despite higher dissolved fluxes in the High Himalayas attributed to high carbonate weathering. The silicate weathering fluxes for High Himalayan small catchments are similar to estimates from the chemistry of large rivers draining the same regions. Much higher silicate weathering intensity for the Ganges basin indicates that the silicate material eroded from the High Himalayas undergoes up to six times as much weathering in the Ganges Plain as in the High Himalayan mountains. Himalayan silicate weathering rates are higher than in equivalent continental settings and, on an area-normalized basis, are comparable to fluxes from weathering of basalts on ocean islands and tropical volcanic provinces.},

Every year, flooding in the Himalayan rivers is usual during summer monsoon, which impacts millions of inhabitants of the Himalayas and downstream regions. Recent studies demonstrate the role of melting glaciers and snow in the context of global warming, along with monsoonal rain causing recurrent floods. Here, we highlight the natural variability in the eastern Himalayan hydroclimate over the last 43 years (1979{\textendash}2021). We found extreme monsoonal rainy years with six dry years and seven wet years after removing the climate change signal. Monsoon rainfall is a significant contributor, and melting snow is not a potential contributor to these anomalous extreme years. The variability of Himalayan monsoonal rainfall is strongly regulated by local monsoonal Hadley circulation associated with tropical sea surface temperature. Our findings demonstrate mechanisms associated with Himalayan wet and dry monsoon. Atmospheric dynamics are attributed as the primary modulating factor, influencing local thermodynamics through moist processes. The insights provided in this study underscore the impact of natural variability-driven challenging events that could be predictable. Thus, this mechanism could improve the predictability of the Himalayas floods.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first systematic survey of lithium and its isotopes in the dissolved load and suspended and bed sediments of tributaries of the Ganges, both before and after the monsoon. Locations were chosen in order to cover catchments draining both silicates and carbonates, at high (2000{\textendash}4000 m) and low (550{\textendash}1300 m) altitudes. Modelling of the dissolved composition shows that the Li / Ca ratio of the silicate endmember in Himalayan rivers is at least an order-of-magnitude higher than that of the carbonate endmember. Most of the dissolved Li (N 90\%) is derived from silicates even in carbonate-dominated catchments. While the Sr-isotope composition of the dissolved load reflects that of the bedrock, the main control on its Liisotope composition is fractionation during weathering. Fractionation between the dissolved and suspended load in silicatedominated catchments is greatest at high altitude and lower at low altitude where weathering is more intense. Tributaries draining silicates have lower dissolved d7Li values (by 2.3x to 4.2x) following the monsoon when weathering is more intense because of higher runoff and elevated temperatures. Our data suggest that riverine Li fluxes largely reflect silicate weathering rates, while riverine d7Li varies with weathering intensity. As rivers presently contribute {\textasciitilde}50\% of the Li input to the oceans, seawater Li concentrations and d7Li show potential as proxies for global silicate weathering processes.},

Arguments center on the sensitivity of chemical weathering to climatic factors, especially temperature. Laboratory studies reveal a strong dependence of mineral dissolution on temperature, but the expression of this dependence in the field is often obscured by other environmental factors that co-vary with temperature. In the field, the clearest correlation is between chemical erosion rates and runoff, indicating an important dependence on the intensity of the hydrological cycle. Numerical models and interpretation of the geologic record reveal that chemical weathering has played a substantial role in both maintaining climatic stability over the eons as well as driving climatic swings in response to tectonic and paleogeographic factors.},

An analysis of weathering rates for granitic material shows that weathering rates depend most strongly on fluid residence times and fluid flow rates, and depend very weakly on material age. Over moderate fluid residence times from 5 days to 10 yr, characteristic of soils and some aquifers, transport-controlled weathering explains the orders of magnitude variation in weathering rates to a better extent than material age. For fluid residence times greater than 10 yr, characteristic of some aquifers, saprolites, and most marine sediments, a purely thermodynamic-control on chemical weathering rates sustains chemical weathering{\textemdash}this control may be due to clay precipitation, which can drive weathering of primary minerals, or microbial processes which alter the fluid chemistry via the oxidation of organic matter. In addition, this analysis suggests that the apparent time dependence of chemical weathering rates commonly used to model the evolution of Earth's landforms may be attributable to transport-controlled weathering and the evolution of hydrologic properties over time. If hydrologic processes are the primary control on chemical weathering rates, the nature of the temperature dependence of chemical weathering rates is also altered.},

  abstract = {The role of fluid residence time and catchment length scales in controlling the chemical composition of rivers is evaluated by comparing numerical simulations and scaling arguments to concentration{\textendash}discharge data from small catchments. The analysis suggests that poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates are an important control on the composition of stream waters and therefore chemical equilibrium between the dissolving and precipitating phases determines the maximum concentration and the maximum silicate weathering flux. The modeling results suggest that the residence time of fluid relative to the residence time required to approach chemical equilibrium can be used to assess the controls on solute fluxes in small catchments, and possibly larger rivers. Catchments that show little variability in concentration with discharge (or ``chemostatic behavior'') likely have average fluid residence times that exceed the time required to reach chemical equilibrium. Conversely, decreases in concentration with increasing discharge are explained by average residence times shorter than required to approach chemical equilibrium, resulting in dilution. Solute fluxes are also strongly impacted by the distribution of fluid residence times in a basin. The fluid residence time model provides an alternative framework for assessing both the relationship between discharge and concentration observed for individual catchments, and controls on the solute fluxes of rivers. If fluid residence times are a dominant control on weathering fluxes, the chemistry of different rivers could vary entirely as a function of the nature subsurface flow paths and the composition of the system at equilibrium, which is complex to predict and strongly coupled to biological processes, temperature and the composition of the system. As a result of thermodynamic and hydrologic restrictions on the amount of weathering, global solute fluxes may depend more strongly on the geometry, relief, runoff and permeability of basins then on temperature and rates of erosion.},

  abstract = {In active mountain belts with steep terrain, bedrock landsliding is a major erosional agent. In the Himalayas, landsliding is driven by annual hydro-meteorological forcing due to the summer monsoon and by rarer, exceptional events, such as earthquakes. Independent methods yield erosion rate estimates that appear to increase with sampling time, suggesting that rare, high-magnitude erosion events dominate the erosional budget. Nevertheless, until now, neither the contribution of monsoon and earthquakes to landslide erosion nor the proportion of erosion due to rare, giant landslides have been quantified in the Himalayas. We address these challenges by combining and analysing earthquake- and monsoon-induced landslide inventories across different timescales. With time series of 5 m satellite images over four main valleys in central Nepal, we comprehensively mapped landslides caused by the monsoon from 2010 to 2018. We found no clear correlation between monsoon properties and landsliding and a similar mean landsliding rate for all valleys, except in 2015, where the valleys affected by the earthquake featured {$\sim$} 5{\textendash}8 times more landsliding than the pre-earthquake mean rate. The longterm size{\textendash}frequency distribution of monsoon-induced landsliding (MIL) was derived from these inventories and from an inventory of landslides larger than {$\sim$} 0.1 km2 that occurred between 1972 and 2014. Using a published landslide inventory for the Gorkha 2015 earthquake, we derive the size{\textendash}frequency distribution for earthquakeinduced landsliding (EQIL). These two distributions are dominated by infrequent, large and giant landslides but under-predict an estimated Holocene frequency of giant landslides ({$>$} 1 km3) which we derived from a literature compilation. This discrepancy can be resolved when modelling the effect of a full distribution of earthquakes of variable magnitude and when considering that a shallower earthquake may cause larger landslides. In this case, EQIL and MIL contribute about equally to a total long-term erosion of {$\sim$} 2 {$\pm$} 0.75 mm yr-1 in agreement with most thermo-chronological data. Independently of the specific total and relative erosion rates, the heavy-tailed size{\textendash}frequency distribution from MIL and EQIL and the very large maximal landslide size in the Himalayas indicate that mean landslide erosion rates increase with sampling time, as has been observed for independent erosion estimates. Further, we find that the sampling timescale required to adequately capture the frequency of the largest landslides, which is necessary for deriving long-term mean erosion rates, is often much longer than the averaging time of cosmogenic 10Be methods. This observation presents a strong caveat when interpreting spatial or temporal variability in erosion rates from this method. Thus, in areas where a very large, rare landslide contributes heavily to long-term erosion (as the Himalayas), we recommend 10Be sample in catchments with source areas {$>$} 10 000 km2 to reduce the method mean bias to below {$\sim$} 20 \% of the long-term erosion.},

A number of studies have investigated sources of error in the relationships between the apparent ages, and the age assumed by models to relate this quantity to an aquifer property (e.g., recharge). These studies have also provided a number of techniques for correcting the known biases of apparent ages. In this paper, we review some of the concepts of age bias. We then demonstrate this bias through the use on four numerical examples, and assess the accuracy of correction methods in overcoming this bias. We examine this for CFCs, SF6, 3H/3He, 39Ar, and 14C. We demonstrate that in our four simple steady-state aquifer examples, bias occurs for a wide range of environmental tracers and flow configurations. When applying correction methods, we found that the values obtained are limited by the model assumptions. Models accounting for exchange with aquitards represent whole mobile zones and not discrete well screens. Mean transit times (comparable to mean ages) obtained from lumped parameter models deviate from actual values as the assumed distribution varies from the actual distribution. Methods that use multiple tracer ages are limited to ranges where both tracers report apparent ages. Our findings suggest that the incorporation of environmental tracer data into the understanding of groundwater systems requires approaches such as the direct use of concentrations, or the simulation of full age distributions.},

  abstract = {The age, or residence time, of water is a fundamental descriptor of catchment hydrology, revealing information about the storage, flow pathways, and source of water in a single integrated measure. While there has been tremendous recent interest in residence time estimation to characterize watersheds, there are relatively few studies that have quantified residence time at the watershed scale, and fewer still that have extended those results beyond single catchments to larger landscape scales. We examined topographic controls on residence time for seven catchments (0.085{\textendash}62.4 km               2               ) that represent diverse geologic and geomorphic conditions in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Our primary objective was to determine the dominant physical controls on catchment-scale water residence time and specifically test the hypothesis that residence time is related to the size of the basin. Residence times were estimated by simple convolution models that described the transfer of precipitation isotopic composition to the stream network. We found that base flow mean residence times for exponential distributions ranged from 0.8 to 3.3 years. Mean residence time showed no correlation to basin area (r               2               {$<$} 0.01) but instead was correlated (r               2               = 0.91) to catchment terrain indices representing the flow path distance and flow path gradient to the stream network. These results illustrate that landscape organization (i.e., topography) rather than basin area controls catchment-scale transport. Results from this study may provide a framework for describing scale-invariant transport across climatic and geologic conditions, whereby the internal form and structure of the basin defines the first-order control on base flow residence time.},

  abstract = {Shallow bedrock strength controls both landslide hazard and the rate and form of erosion, yet regional patterns in near-surface mechanical properties are rarely known quantitatively due to the challenge in collecting in situ measurements. Here we present seismic and geomechanical characterizations of the shallow subsurface across the central Himalayan Range in Nepal. By pairing widely distributed 1D shear wave velocity surveys and engineering outcrop descriptions per the Geological Strength Index classification system, we evaluate landscape-scale patterns in near-surface mechanical characteristics and their relation to environmental factors known to affect rock strength. We find that shallow bedrock strength is more dependent on the degree of chemical and physical weathering, rather than the mineral and textural differences between the metamorphic lithologies found in the central Himalaya. Furthermore, weathering varies systematically with topography. Bedrock ridge top sites are highly weathered and have S-wave seismic velocities and shear strength characteristics that are more typical of soils, whereas sites near valley bottoms tend to be less weathered and characterized by high S-wave velocities and shear strength estimates typical of rock. Weathering on hillslopes is significantly more variable, resulting in S-wave velocities that range between the ridge and channel endmembers. We speculate that variability in the hillslope environment may be partly explained by the episodic nature of mass wasting, which clears away weathered material where landslide scars are recent. These results underscore the mechanical heterogeneity in the shallow subsurface and highlight the need to account for variable bedrock weathering when estimating strength parameters for regional landslide hazard analysis.},

  abstract = {Bedrock weathering regulates nutrient mobilization, water storage, and soil production. Relative to the mobile soil layer, little is known about the relationship between topography and bedrock weathering. Here, we identify a common pattern of weathering and water storage across a sequence of three ridges and valleys in the sedimentary Great Valley Sequence in Northern California that share a tectonic and climate history. Deep drilling, downhole logging, and characterization of chemistry and porosity reveal two weathering fronts. The shallower front is {$\sim$}7 m deep at the ridge of all three hillslopes, and marks the extent of pervasive fracturing and oxidation of pyrite and organic carbon. A deeper weathering front marks the extent of open fractures and discoloration. This front is 11 m deep under two ridges of similar ridge-valley spacing, but 17.5 m deep under a ridge with nearly twice the ridge-valley spacing. Hence, at ridge tops, the fraction of the hillslope relief that is weathered scales with hillslope length. In all three hillslopes, below this second weathering front, closed fractures and unweathered bedrock extend about one-half the hilltop elevation above the adjacent channels. Neutron probe surveys reveal that seasonally dynamic moisture is stored to approximately the same depth as the shallow weathering front. Under the channels that bound our study hillslopes, the two weathering fronts coincide and occur within centimeters of the ground surface. Our findings provide evidence for feedbacks between erosion and weathering in mountainous landscapes that result in systematic subsurface structuring and water routing.},

Despite this dominance of silicate rocks, carbonate weathering{\textemdash}probably of metamorphic calcite in Great Himalayan paragneisses{\textemdash}is clearly in evidence in many Arun watersheds. Weathering of silicate rocks exposed all along the Arun south of the range front has a small impact on mainstem river chemistry. The mainstems of both the Seti and Arun systems are dominated by weathering of carbonate rocks, although the contribution of silicate weathering is more visible in Arun mainstem chemistry. The carbonate weathering source to the Arun mainstem is probably both limestone in the Tethyan Sequence widely exposed in northern headwaters of the system, and metamorphic calcite within the Greater Himalayan Sequence.},

  abstract = {Coseismic landslides pose immediate and prolonged hazards to mountainous communities, and provide a rare opportunity to study the effect of large earthquakes on erosion and sediment budgets. By mapping landslides using high-resolution satellite imagery, we find that the 25 April 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake and aftershock sequence produced at least 25,000 landslides throughout the steep Himalayan Mountains in central Nepal. Despite early reports claiming lower than expected landslide activity, our results show that the total number, area, and volume of landslides associated with the Gorkha event are consistent with expectations, when compared to prior landslide-triggering earthquakes around the world. The extent of landsliding mimics the extent of fault rupture along the east-west trace of the Main Himalayan Thrust and increases eastward following the progression of rupture. In this event, maximum modeled Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) and the steepest topographic slopes of the High Himalaya are not spatially coincident, so it is not surprising that landslide density correlates neither with PGA nor steepest slopes on their own. Instead, we find that the highest landslide density is located at the confluence of steep slopes, high mean annual precipitation, and proximity to the deepest part of the fault rupture from which 0.5{\textendash}2 Hz seismic energy originated. We suggest that landslide density was determined by a combination of earthquake source characteristics, slope distributions, and the influence of precipitation on rock strength via weathering and changes in vegetation cover. Determining the relative contribution of each factor will require further modeling and better constrained seismic parameters, both of which are likely to be developed in the coming few years as post-event studies evolve. Landslide mobility, in terms of the ratio of runout distance to fall height, is comparable to small volume landslides in other settings, and landslide volume-runout scaling is consistent with compilations of data on larger slope failures. In general, the size ratios of landslide source area to full landslide area are smaller than global averages, and hillslope length seems to largely control runout distance, which we propose reflects a topographic control on landslide mobility in this setting. We find that landslide size dictates runout distance and that more than half of the landslide debris was deposited in direct connection with stream channels. Connectivity, which is defined as the spatial proximity of landslides to fluvial channels, is greatest for larger landslides in the high-relief part of the High Himalaya. Although these failures are less abundant than those at lower elevations, they may have a disproportionate impact on sediment dynamics and cascading hazards, such as landslide reactivation by monsoon rainfall and landslide dams that lead to outburst floods. The overall high fluvial connectivity of coseismic landsliding in the Gorkha event suggests coupling between the earthquake cycle and sediment/geochemical budgets of fluvial systems in the Himalaya.},

  abstract = {We describe a formulation to solve reactive transport problems. The basic idea is to represent transport as mixing water instead of individual solute concentrations, hence the Water Mixing Approach (WMA) name. This representation simplifies calculations as it decouples transport from chemical calculations. Transport is first solved in terms of water mixing ratios ({$\lambda$}), which is feasible for any transport solution method. Chemical calculations can then be written as reactive mixing calculations, which may be non-linear but local, so that they do not need to iterate with transport. We have implemented the WMA to a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian method transport solver with streamline-oriented grid and constant travel time between sequential cells (isochronal grid), which is free of numerical dispersion. We test the WMA on two reactive transport cases. First, an existing analytical solution of binary system case is used compared to test accuracy of the using of mixing ratios. Second, a calcite dissolution case compared the WMA to the Direct Substitution Approach to test both accuracy and computational cost (CPU). Results confirm the high accuracy and efficiency (low CPU cost) due decoupling transport and chemical steps, especially for a refined grid was. Transport through highly heterogeneous media remains a challenge, but the definite separation of mixing processes in WMA opens a new path for reactive transport modelling.},

  abstract = {The time that water takes to travel through the terrestrial hydrological cycle and the critical zone is of great interest in Earth system sciences with broad implications for water quality and quantity. Most water age studies to date have focused on individual compartments (or subdisciplines) of the hydrological cycle such as the unsaturated or saturated zone, vegetation, atmosphere, or rivers. However, recent studies have shown that processes at the interfaces between the hydrological compartments (e.g., soil-atmosphere or soil-groundwater) govern the age distribution of the water fluxes between these compartments and thus can greatly affect water travel times. The broad variation from complete to nearly absent mixing of water at these interfaces affects the water ages in the compartments. This is especially the case for the highly heterogeneous critical zone between the top of the vegetation and the bottom of the groundwater storage. Here, we review a wide variety of studies about water ages in the critical zone and provide (1) an overview of new prospects and challenges in the use of hydrological tracers to study water ages, (2) a discussion of the limiting assumptions linked to our lack of process understanding and methodological transfer of water age estimations to individual disciplines or compartments, and (3) a vision for how to improve future interdisciplinary efforts to better understand the feedbacks between the atmosphere, vegetation, soil, groundwater, and surface water that control water ages in the critical zone. Plain language Summary Investigating how long it takes for a drop of rainwater until it is either evaporated back to the atmosphere, taken up by plants, or infiltrated into groundwater or discharged in streams provides new understanding of how water flows through the water cycle. Knowledge about the time water travels further helps assessing groundwater recharge, transport of contaminants, and weathering rates. Such water age studies typically focus either on water in individual compartments of the water cycle such as soils, groundwater, or stream runoff. But we argue that the interfaces between these compartments can have an influence on the water age. Here, we present methods how water ages can be estimated using tracers and hydrological models. We further discuss the ``demographics of water'' (water age distribution) in the critical zone that spans from the tree canopy to the bottom of the groundwater. Our review highlights how water flows and mixes between plants, soils, groundwater, and streams and how this interaction affects the water ages. This way, our work contributes toward a better understanding of vital resource water sustaining the life in the Earth's living skin.},

  abstract = {Lithium isotopes are a relatively novel tracer of present and past silicate weathering processes. Given that silicate weathering is the primary long-term method by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere, Li isotope research is going through an exciting phase. We show the weathering processes that fractionate dissolved and sedimentary Li isotope ratios, focusing on weathering intensity and clay formation. We then discuss the carbonate and silicate archive potential of past seawater d7Li. These archives have been used to examine Li isotope changes across both short and long timescales. The former can demonstrate the rates at which the climate is stabilised from perturbations via weathering, a fundamental piece of the puzzle of the long-term carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Groundwater residence time distributions provide fundamental insights on the hydrological processes within watersheds. Yet, observations that can constrain groundwater residence times over broad timescales remain scarce in mountain catchment studies. We use environmental tracers (CFC-12, SF6, {$\mkern1mu$}3H, and {$\mkern1mu$}4He) to investigate groundwater residence times along a hillslope in the East River Watershed, Colorado, USA. We develop a Bayesian inference framework that applies a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to estimate noble gas recharge temperature, elevation, and excess-air parameters and the resulting environmental tracer concentrations. MCMC is then used to propagate the environmental tracer uncertainties to estimates of groundwater mean residence times inferred with lumped parameter models. All samples contain {$\mkern1mu$}3H, CFC-12, and SF6 in addition to terrigenic {$\mkern1mu$}4He, suggesting a mixture of water characterized by modern and premodern residence times. {$\mkern1mu$}4He exponential mean residence times range from hundreds of years at the upslope well to thousands of years at the toe-slope well assuming average crustal production rates. We find that binary mixing residence time distributions with separate young and old mixing fractions are needed to predict the {$\mkern1mu$}4He, CFC-12, SF6, and {$\mkern1mu$}3H observations, supporting the importance of flow path mixing in this bedrock system. Our findings that the fractured bedrock hosts groundwater with a mixture of residence times ranging from decades to millennia suggest variable recharge dynamics and flow path mixing along the hillslope and highlight the importance of characterizing groundwater systems with observations that are sensitive to transport over a broad range of residence times.},

  abstract = {Large seasonal variations in the dissolved load of the headwater tributaries of the Marsyandi river (Nepal Himalaya) for major cations and 87Sr/86Sr ratios are interpreted to result from a greater dissolution of carbonate relative to silicate at high runoff. There is up to a 0.003 decrease in strontium isotope ratios and a factor of 3 reduction in the Si(OH)4/Ca ratio during the monsoon. These variations, in small rivers sampling uniform lithologies, result from a different response of carbonate and silicate mineral dissolution to climatic forcing. Similar trends are observed in compiled literature data, from both Indian and Nepalese Himalayan rivers. Carbonate weathering is more sensitive to monsoonal runoff because of its faster dissolution kinetics. Silicate weathering increases relative to carbonate during the dry season, and may be more predominant in groundwater with longer water{\textendash}rock interaction times. Despite this kinetic effect, silicate weathering fluxes are dominated by the monsoon flux, when between 50\% and 70\% of total annual silicate weathering flux occurs.},

  abstract = {Although agriculturally accelerated soil erosion is implicated in the unsustainable environmental degradation of mountain environments, such as in the Himalaya, the effects of land use can be challenging to quantify in many mountain settings because of the high and variable natural background rates of erosion. In this study, we present new long-term denudation rates, derived from cosmogenic 10Be analysis of quartz in river sediment from the Likhu Khola, a small agricultural river basin in the Middle Hills of central Nepal. Calculated long-term denudation rates, which reflect background natural erosion processes over 1000+ years prior to agricultural intensification, are similar to present-day sediment yields and to soil loss rates from terraces that are well maintained. Similarity in short- and long-term catchment-wide erosion rates for the Likhu is consistent with data from elsewhere in the Nepal Middle Hills but contrasts with the very large increases in short-term erosion rates seen in agricultural catchments in other steep mountain settings. Our results suggest that the large sediment fluxes exported from the Likhu and other Middle Hills rivers in the Himalaya are derived in large part from natural processes, rather than from soil erosion as a result of agricultural activity. Catchment-scale erosional fluxes may be similar over short and long timescales if both are dominated by mass wasting sources such as gullies, landslides, and debris flows (e.g., as is evident in the landslide-dominated Khudi Khola of the Nepal High Himalaya, based on compiled data). As a consequence, simple comparison of catchment-scale fluxes will not necessarily pinpoint land use effects on soils where these are only a small part of the total erosion budget, unless rates of mass wasting are also considered. Estimates of the mass wasting contribution to erosion in the Likhu imply catchment-averaged soil production rates on the order of {$\sim$} 0.25{\textendash}0.35 mm yr-1, though rates of mass wasting are poorly constrained. The deficit between our best estimates for soil production rates and measurements of soil loss rates supports conclusions from previous studies that terraced agriculture in the Likhu may not be associated with a large systematic soil deficit, at least when terraces are well maintained, but that poorly managed terraces, forest, and scrubland may lead to rapid depletion of soil resources.},

  abstract = {Understanding the controls on chemical weathering, especially of silicate minerals, remains a major challenge, despite its importance in controlling the evolution of the Earth's surface. In particular, it has proved hard to distinguish the temperature sensitivity of silicate weathering rates from other factors. Here we present a new compilation of chemical and physical erosion rates in small catchments and show that silicate weathering rates are not governed by any single parameter but require consideration in multiple dimensions. The overall variation in silicate weathering rates with physical erosion rates, rainfall, and temperature can be quantitatively described by a parameterization based on considering their limiting relationships. At lower erosion rates mineral supply limits weathering. At higher erosion rates there is abundant material but kinetic and therefore climatic factors limit weathering. A predictive model describing the field data based on transport and weathering (kinetically) limited scenarios yields theoretically sensible values for fitted parameters. In the transport-limited case, the supply of silicate cations from weathering is directly proportional to the supply of material by erosion, consistent with complete leaching of cations from fresh regolith. In the kinetically limited case, weathering scales directly with runoff, as the square root of erosion rate, and with an activation energy of 74 F 29 kJ/mol, consistent with expected values in the Earth's surface settings.

In contrast, the corresponding plagioclase reaction rate for partially kaolinized Panola Granite, after reaching steady-state weathering after 2 months of reactions, was significantly less (2.1 {\^A} 10{\`A} 15 mol m{\`A} 2 s{\`A} 1). Both rates were normalized to plagioclase content and BET surface area. Extrapolation of decreasing rates for the fresh plagioclase with time indicated that several thousand years of reaction would be required to replicate the rate of the naturally weathered plagioclase under identical experimental conditions. Both rates would remain orders of magnitude faster than field weathering rates previously measured for a weathering profile in the Panola Granite.},

Based on the Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) at 3810 m, 5315 m, 6464 m, 7945 m and 8430 m asl on the southern slope of Mt. Everest, this study investigates the meteorological characteristics and water vapor transport in the Mt. Everest region from June 2019 to June 2021. The results show that (1) with the increase of altitude, the temperature lapse rate becomes deeper from -4.7 {$\smwhtcircle$}C km-1 to -8.1 {$\smwhtcircle$}C km-1; (2) the relative humidity increases significantly in summer, and precipitation during the monsoon period accounts for more than 70\% of the annual total; and (3) during the monsoon in 2020, the number of days with negative daily water vapor divergence in the whole layer accounted for 31\% at the height from ground to 350 hPa, and the moisture amount transported through water vapor convergence was about 122 mm. The study indicates that, with sufficient moisture supply, strong water vapor convergence and a relatively large vertical velocity, a small amount of water vapor can climb to an extreme height and be transported from the southern to the northern slope of the Himalayas.},
