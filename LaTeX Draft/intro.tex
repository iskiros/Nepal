\section{Introduction}

Silicate weathering, whereby silicate minerals are dissolved by carbonic acid, 
sequesters atmospheric CO$_2$ over long (10$^6$ year) timescales, influencing global climate regulation. As water passes through the subsurface, it interacts with the surrounding rock. This causes the addition of solute species to the groundwater, and the formation of stable secondary minerals through the dissolution of primary minerals formed at different pressure and temperature. The Himalayan mountain range spans more than 590,000 km$^2$, and is the source of major rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus. It is therefore a key region for understanding the global carbon cycle. In highly erosive regions where the supply of silicate minerals far exceeds the weathering rate, silicate weathering reactions are thought to be sensitive to climate. These are regions are called "kinetically-limited" (Stallard \& Edmund 1983 JGR, West et al, 2005) The dissolution kinetics of the silicate rocks in these catchments are thought to be sensitive to temperature and runoff because the weathering reactions have not gone to completion. Silicate weathering in the Himalayas as a result of their uplift and erosion in the Cenozoic may have contributed significantly to the global cooling over the past 40 million years (Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992; West et al, 2005, Kump et al, 2000 Ann Rev Earth Sci). Thus, it is this reported sensitivity to climate as well as their large size that makes them important to study. Models built on this sensitivity ("Fontorbe models" from now on) are used to simulate groundwater through one-dimensional flow paths based on a few key parameters, which make up the "weathering fingerprint" of a catchment (Fontorbe et al., 2013). More recent models have proposed silicate weathering is more sensitive to the hydrological cycle, than to temperature (Maher, 2011). The underlying assumption in these ("Maher models" from now on) is that all weathering paths approach equilibrium. If equilibrium is indeed approached in a particular catchment, then the Maher model is more suitable for use.

\bsk

The weathering fingerprints of these catchments contain many unknowns, namely the residence time of the water, flow path direction and length, rate of reaction, and extent to which equilibrium is reached. Understanding residence time in particular is important because the geochemical and biogeochemical reactions that are used to quantify weathering are time-dependent; longer residence times promote greater solute accumulation in the water (Berner, 1978). These geochemical reactions are also controlled by the reaction rate which is thought to vary as equilibrium is approached (White and Brantley, 2003; Maher, 2011). Therefore, an understanding of residence time will provide insight into how long weathering reactions take place in a given catchment, whether they reach equilibrium, and what this means for the carbon cycle as a whole. Residence time will also reflect the variety of flow routes within a catchment because of physical constraints like Darcy's law, which will help to improve hydrological models. The aim of this study is to compare the Fontorbe and Maher models and their estimation of residence time, and assess their applicability to a real-world catchment.

\bsk

From the model comparison will come a better understanding of fluid residence times in Himalayan catchments, for which tracer data is already commonly used to infer how long a water packet spends in the subsurface (Atwood et al, 2021). Previous studies on Melamchi have used CFC and SF$_6$ gases to determine a mean age on the order of ten years for groundwater at the base of the catchment ridge (Atwood et al, 2021). Using the chemical composition of the water will provide a different way of obtaining residence times, and give a benchmark for the tracer data, which is often reported to be limited in its application (McCallum et al, 2015). If the residence time of a particular water packet is long enough, the reaction will reach chemical equilibrium, meaning the free energy of the system will be close to zero. Comparison of these residence times with estimates of free energy derived from the measured concentration of springwater in the catchment will provide a test on the validity of the two models and their assumptions.

\bsk

The rate of weathering is dependent on the mineralogy of the rock. Different minerals weather at different rates: quartz > albite > mafic silicates > anorthite > carbonates. Therefore, the most reactive minerals will contribute disprportionately to the solute load of the water (Shand et al, 1999). In the Melamchi catchment, only weathering through carbonic acid is considered. Weathering through sulfuric acid is also a big player in the global weathering budget, but its impact is not considered in this study because the marine deposits required for its formation are not present in the Melamchi region (Bufe et al., 2021). Differences in lithology are thought to affect weathering. Geological differences lead to differences in soil composition, landscape features, vegetation, and climate which in turn affect the rates of reaction. Logically, the contribution of one lithology to weathering is correlated to its spatial extent in the catchment (Stallard and Edmond, 1983). Porosities vary widely across a catchment depending on the rock type encountered (Singh et al, 1987; David et al, 1994). Porosity also increases as a rock becomes more weathered (Marques et al, 2009). Weathering regimes can be classified as either transport-limited or kinetically limited (West et al., 2005). West et al. (2005) distinguish the two regimes by the rate of erosion in the catchment. In low erosion rate settings, weathering is transport-limited due to limited mineral supply. Weathering here is therefore proportional to the material eroded. In high erosion rate settings, weathering is kinetically-limited due to an abundant mineral supply. Rapidly eroding catchments like Melamchi are therefore likely kinetically-limited. Soil properties and topography are used to identify different "weathering regimes" in the subsurface (Pedrazas et al, 2021). Indeed, bedrock strength is thought to be more dependent on weathering than mineral or textural differences between the metamorphic lithologies in the Himalayas (Medwedeff et al, 2021). Understanding the extent of weathering can therefore serve to predict the stability of bedrock in rapidly eroding regions. 

\bsk

The strontium isotope composition of different rock types is indicative of different formation mechanisms and conditions. This is used to track the relative contributions of weathering and hydrothermal circulation inputs in seawater (Edmond, 1992). The rock signature imparts a strontium isotopic composition to groundwater that reacts with it in the subsurface. Hence, measuring the strontium isotopic composition of groundwater can provide information on provenance and mixing between streams that react with different lithologies (Faure, 2001).

\bsk

Rates of reaction during weathering comprise both dissolution and precipitation, and chemical equilibrium is defined as that state where these are balanced and equal. Rates of reaction are thought to be different depending on whether they are measured in the field or in a laboratory (Maher et al., 2009). This difference has been explained by denoting 'extrinsic' qualities that are variable in the field, such as permeability and mineral/fluid ratios (White and Brantley, 2003). The rate of reaction of a system has also been linked to the free energy of the system, with laboratory rates being calculated significantly further away from equilibrium than field rates (Kampman et al, 2009). This implies that field localities are closer to equilibrium than laboratory-derived rates might suggest.

The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) in Nepal is characterised by a strong seasonal reversal of winds, which brings heavy rainfall to the region during the summer months, and dry conditions during the winter (Bookhagen and Burbank, 2010). The monsoon brings a large amount of precipitation to the region. Oxygen isotopes suggest most of the precipitation occurs in the higher elevation parts of the catchment, and this is supported by remotely sensed rainfall estimates in the region (Acharya et al, 2020; Bookhagen and Burbank, 2010). Precipitation and discharge relationships in the Himalayas have been used to suggest that there is a three month lag in the response of the river to precipitation (Andermann et al., 2012). The residence time of groundwater can be used to quantify this delay and nature of its origin, given that rain is the main source of recharge to the groundwater system (Illien et al, 2021). Studying small catchments gives the opportunity to attribute large changes in water chemistry to seasonal climate changes like the monsoon (Tipper et al., 2006).  Seasonal variation in rainfall is thought to relate to different hydrological regimes, whereby river discharge and precipitation are 'coupled' when there is a significant enough amount of water to recharge the groundwater system. (Illien et al, 2021) The seasonal variation in precipitation therefore also translates to a variation in runoff, whereby this is twelve times stronger during the monsoon than during the dry season (Sharma, 1997). 

\bsk

Changes in climate contribute to changes in the monsoonal system dynamics. The start of the monsoon has not changed in Nepal, but the end has been delayed. This has led to more intense precipitation on a per day basis, which is detrimental for crops in the winter season due to lack of moisture. Intense precipitation is also considered the main climatic cause of flooding (Panthi et al, 2015; Baniya et al, 2012). "One-off" landslide events transport as much as four times the flux of sediment deposited in the valley in a year (Chen C et al., 2023). These events are thought to be increasing in frequency over recent years as a result of climate change, increasing the erosion rate in these areas (Adhikari et al, 2023). In particular, effects of a flash flood in 2021 are still visible in the area, with damage done to several bridges and hundreds of families.

In this study, spring and rain samples from the Melamchi region of Nepal are used as a case study to investigate the weathering rates in a kinetically-limited catchment.

The sample dataset consists of 372 samples spanning four field campaigns over three years (2021-2024), as well as more recent year-long bi-weekly timeseries data from stream and spring samples in sites across the catchment. Of those, 68 were collected in September 2024 for this study. This dataset comprises major ion concentrations, alkalinity, and radiogenic strontium isotopes from the Melamchi catchment.

% \subsection{Defining Weathering}

% As water passes through the subsurface, it interacts with rock. This causes the addition of solute species to water, and the formation of stable secondary minerals through the dissolution of primary minerals formed at different pressure and temperature. Dissolved CO$_2$ derived from the atmosphere present in rainfall makes it slightly acidic:\\
% \begin{equation}
% H_2O + CO_2 \rightarrow H_2CO_3 \rightarrow HCO_3^- + H^+
% \end{equation}\\
% Once the rainfall enters the soil as groundwater, the acidicity is further increased by the presence of decomposition of organic matter, and CO$_2$ production from organic activity in the soil.

% \bsk

% The rate of weathering is dependent on the mineralogy of the rock. Different minerals weather at different rates: quartz > albite > mafic silicates > anorthite > carbonates. Therefore, the most reactive minerals will contribute disprportionately to the solute load of the water (Shand et al, 1999). In the Melamchi catchment, only the weathering of carbonic acid is considered. Sulfuric acid is also often considered a big player in weathering, but its impact is not considered in this study because the pyrite deposits required for its formation are not present in lithological studies of the Melamchi region.

Indeed, bedrock strength is thought to be more dependent on weathering than mineral or textural differences between the metamorphic lithologies in the Himalayas (Medwedeff et al, 2021).



% \subsection{Reaction Rates in Natural and Laboratory Settings}

% Rates of reaction during weathering comprise both dissolution and precipitation, and chemical equilibrium is defined as that state where these are balanced and equal. Rates of reaction are thought to be different depending on whether they are measured in the field or in a laboratory (Maher et al., 2009).

% \subsection{Response to Monsoonal Precipitation}

% The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is characterised by a strong seasonal reversal of winds, which brings heavy rainfall to the region during the summer months, and dry conditions during the winter (Bookhagen and Burbank, 2010). The monsoon brings a large amount of precipitation to the region.

% \bsk

% Andermann et al. (2012) report anticlockwise hysteresis loops of precipitation against discharge (include figure?), and suggest that there is a three month lag in the response of the river to precipitation.  The delay in river discharge is a topic of debate. Andermann et al. (2012) propose that at lower elevations, it is more likely due to groundwater storage of precipitation in the fractured basement. Bookhagen and Burbank (2010) suggest that the delay of precipitation and discharge may be due to the response of glaciers at higher elevations. They also suggest evaportranspiration has a low impact on the hydrological budget of the Himalayas, less than 10\%. Other studies have found that catchments with little glacial input show the same delay, suggesting that the former hypothesis may be more relevant to this discussion (McGuire et al, 2005). The residence time of groundwater can hence be used to quantify this delay and nature of its origin, given that rain is the main source of recharge to the groundwater system (Illien et al, 2021).
